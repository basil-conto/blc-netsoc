title: Hi!

I'm Basil L. Contovounesios, an undergraduate computer science student in
Trinity College Dublin.

In case you're interested, I'm currently pursuing a nascent passion for all
things Haskell (see footer).

My [CV](CV-Contovounesios-Basil.pdf) and recent [reading](reading.html)
paint a broader picture.

While you're here, why don't you have a reluctant and reserved look at some of
my peers' sites? I guarantee a thrilling, if not existential, experience:

  * [seanlth.com](http://seanlth.com)
  * [samcaulfield.com](http://samcaulfield.com)
  * *...I promise I have more peers...*

*Please excuse the lacking and distasteful nature of this site---it's under
 construction (indefinitely).*
